                    Hello, My name is Ashi Jain. I recently completed my post-graduation degree in Master of Computer Application from NRI college, Bhopal. Currently I am pursuing my Full Stack Web Development Course from Internshala. Now, I am looking for my first full-time job. I cannot say with 100% confidence where I see myself in five years or what my big career goal is. The world is changing rapidly, and I don’t have enough professional experience to be certain about such things. However, I know that I can provide a fresh take and an extraordinary approach to every project. I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and learn new things quickly. I want to become a team player and dedicate all my skills and talents to develop high-quality and unique products.<br/>
